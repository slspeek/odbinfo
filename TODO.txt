Fix 'recursive calls' i basicfunction

Nicer ids, based on names

If SubForms, Controls are not excluded they should
have the dependencies, not its containing Form
And how about Library, Module and BasicFunction then?

Clean up files after make_site if no config.keepfiles is specified

Report dependencies when commandtype=command (should inherit from the
embedded query)

Relevant control filter:
  ListBox handling
  eventlisteners parsing

Graphs:
  - for table, queries, Views
  - for basicfunction, library, module
  - object with direct uses and used_bies

type file based MetaData, TextDocument

print --> logger.info
logging window (sfriederichs.github.io/how-to/python/gui/logging/2017/12/21/Python-GUI-Logging.html)

Weave in Configuration
dataclass Config with sections to yaml in ~/.odbinfo.yaml

templates: Grid rendering like Subform

Flex tutorial

class Dependend for DataObject s that possible use another object?

database (driver) information retrieval

make typing more complete (lot of work)

look into GoHugo submenus

Demonstration database Herbarium
-------------------------------
Species, Genus, Family, Order, Class, Phylum, Kingdom, Domain,
Attributes, Observations, Locations
Macros that open browser on interesting Plant sites




parent relationships
--------------------
parent inherits dependencies from children (e.g. form inhertis from SubForm and Controls)



make e2e test (BaseDocumenter2dot example)


look at Identifier construction at dependency.py:69

color highlight strings in render-token templates

test_basic_parser_slow.py: parametrize and regression

Configuration
-------------
start with config.xcs, config.xcu and programmatically write and read them

Want sensible defaults for all settings.

Location of generated site
Include/Exclude parts
Database identifier in textdocuments
Link to odb file and related text-documents for download,

See BaseDocumenter config too

GUI
---
Settings dialog
Progress dialog


general
-------
direct sql queries must be transformed to Query object

installation check
------------------
UI and suggestions

SubForm command type is command
ListBox command type is command

dependency search matrix
------------------------
Macro calls in controls (eventlisteners)
tables, views, queries in ListBox
textdocuments in basic (done)gr
tables in tables (via its keys) (done)
tables, views in views (done)
tables, queries, views in queries (done)
tables, queries, views in reports (done)
tables, queries,views, reports in basic (done)
basic in basic (done)
tables, queries, views in forms (subforms)
tables, views, queries in textdocuments (done)

python in python (nice to have)
others in python (nice to have)

field are done last as they are nice to have
datafield-referer class as super for Control, QueryColumn, DatabaseDisplay (Report field)


errors in parser need improvement

better description of the extension

update minimal theme (20210703 ok)

Later
-----
i18n gettext in python, hugo {{ T id }}

Limitations
-----------
Dialogs, Toolbars, Toolbarcontrols are omitted
Macro recursive calls are not considered
Controls more specific, eg Button...
IsCurrency Column omitted
Catalog excluded
KeyColumns, IndexColumns not used fully
