shared_datadir problems: two packages pure and oo, make soft-link? I want one shared dir.
Joining back packages? SOFTLINK SEEMS TO WORK



file-fixtures (*.pickle) are dependend, so Makefile should have three dependend
subgoals for fixture.
1) test_reader_regression (metadata_fixture)
2) 

fix: odb files touched in source tree
test_core: monkeypatch.chdir in generate_report, to avoid /tmp/.. paths

test_basic_parser_slow.py: parametrize and regression

not libreoffice but  a doc should be the fixture,
libreoffice fixtures should be session scope

Configuration
-------------
start with config.xcs, config.xcu and programmatically write and read them

Want sensible defaults for all settings.

Location of generated site
Include/Exclude parts
Database identifier in textdocuments

See BaseDocumenter config too

GUI
---
Settings dialog
Progress dialog


general
-------
direct sql queries must be transformed to Query object

installation check
------------------
UI and suggestions


dependencies representation
---------------------------
datatype must extend generic super dataclass
with
  title
  shortname
  uses
  used_by
  parent

or make a list of triplets
(Object1, Obj2, 'queries')
object1 = ("EmployeeBenefits", "query")
Obj2 = ("Employee", "table")

dependency search matrix
------------------------
tables, queries in queries
tables, queries in forms
fields, tables, queries, macros(2x) in formcontrols
tables, queries in reports
fields, tables, queries in reports
fields, tables, queries in textdocuments
tables, queries in macros(2x)
macros in macros

errors in parser need improvement

better description of the extension

make e2e test (BaseDocumenter2dot example)

Limitations
-----------
Macro recursive calls are not considered
Controls more specific, eg Button...
IsCurrency Column omitted
Catalog excluded
KeyColumns, IndexColumns not used fully
