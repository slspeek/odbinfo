Configuration: places to look for textdocuments

Property test with abstractproperties: does a dataclass
implement such an abstractproperty

Only PageOwner needs a unique title
Get rid of TitleFromParents etc


More of pathlib instead of os.path

Makefile: cleanup minimal before distribution

Relevant function filter
- function that uses something else than a basicfunction
- function that is used by something else than a basicfunction

Module: uses? Separate PageOwner from UseAggregator

Uses should become a multiset

templates:
- Form; controls linked to sun API docs.
- refactor render-subform
- render-token-callable leaves empty id in html
- render-linked-string needs different arguments
- color highlight strings in render-token templates
- ListBox.listsourcetype needs inventarisation

  todo: VALUELIST, SQLPASSTHOUGH, TABLEFIELDS

make upgrade dependencies (20210813 done)

Extra graphs:
  - for table, queries, Views
  - for basicfunction, library, module
  - object with direct uses and used_bies

type file based MetaData, TextDocument

database (driver) information retrieval


Demonstration database Herbarium
-------------------------------
Species, Genus, Family, Order, Class, Phylum, Kingdom, Domain,
Attributes, Observations, Locations
Macros that open browser on interesting Plant sites


Testing
-------
make e2e test (BaseDocumenter2dot example)
test_basic_parser_slow.py: parametrize and regression


look at Identifier construction at dependency.py:69



Configuration
-------------
start with config.xcs, config.xcu and programmatically write and read them

Want sensible defaults for all settings.

Location of generated site
Include/Exclude parts
Database identifier in textdocuments
Link to odb file and related text-documents for download,

See BaseDocumenter config too


GUI
---
Settings dialog
Progress dialog
print --> logger.info
logging window (sfriederichs.github.io/how-to/python/gui/logging/2017/12/21/Python-GUI-Logging.html)


installation check
------------------
UI and suggestions

better description of the extension

update minimal theme (20210703 ok)

Later
-----
bypass wget --convert-links with a rewrite in python of public/
- level 0 strip leading /
- level 1 strip leading /, add ../
- level 2 strip leading /, add ../../

Use LibYAML with pyyaml (on linux?)
caching of query parsing
- https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/shelve.html

direct sql queries must be transformed to Query object
Threads: writer, parser?
i18n gettext in python, hugo {{ T id }}
make typing more complete (lot of work)
errors in parser need improvement
Clean up files after make_site if no config.keepfiles is specified
field are done last as they are nice to have
datafield-referer class as super for Control, QueryColumn, DatabaseDisplay (Report field)
python in python (nice to have)
others in python (nice to have)
look into GoHugo submenus

Limitations
-----------
Dialogs, Toolbars, Toolbarcontrols are omitted
Macro recursive calls are not considered
Controls more specific, eg Button...
IsCurrency Column omitted
Catalog excluded
KeyColumns, IndexColumns not used fully
