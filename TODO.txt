Grid rendering like Subform

BasicCall module_token Optional? Why no mypy warning?

layout: tables index shorter

give thought to parent relationships

make e2e test (BaseDocumenter2dot example)

scroll down little bit after bookmark link in modules (see basedocumenter2dot)

look at Identifier construction at dependency.py:49

color highlight strings in render-token templates

test_basic_parser_slow.py: parametrize and regression

Configuration
-------------
start with config.xcs, config.xcu and programmatically write and read them

Want sensible defaults for all settings.

Location of generated site
Include/Exclude parts
Database identifier in textdocuments

See BaseDocumenter config too

GUI
---
Settings dialog
Progress dialog


general
-------
direct sql queries must be transformed to Query object

installation check
------------------
UI and suggestions


dependencies representation
---------------------------
datatype must extend generic super dataclass
with
  title
  shortname
  uses
  used_by
  parent


dependency search matrix
------------------------
tables, views in views (done)
tables, queries, views in queries (done)
tables, queries, views in reports (done, except commandtype=command)
tables, queries,views, reports in basic (done)
basic in basic (done)
tables, queries, views in forms (subforms)
tables, queries, views, macros in formcontrols
tables, views, queries in textdocuments
python in python (nice to have)
others in python (nice to have)
field are done last as they are nice to have

Both macros and queries are parsed and have more detailed dependencies,
in the sense that they are referenced by a token. Use cases should include this
token.

errors in parser need improvement

better description of the extension


Limitations
-----------
Macro recursive calls are not considered
Controls more specific, eg Button...
IsCurrency Column omitted
Catalog excluded
KeyColumns, IndexColumns not used fully
