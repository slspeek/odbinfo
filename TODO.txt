Module: uses? Separate PageOwner from UseAggregator

Uses should become a multiset

templates:
- link2url should fail if target non-existent (i.e. when it returns "")
- refactor render-subform
- render-token-callable leaves empty id in html
- render-linked-string obsolete, but needs replacement

writing: token to dict

ListBox.listsourcetype needs inventarisation

todo: VALUELIST, SQLPASSTHOUGH, TABLEFIELDS

make upgrade dependencies (20210813 done)

Like NamedNode.users_match have a method on Node.link_use

Relevant control filter, Relevant function filter

Graphs:
  - for table, queries, Views
  - for basicfunction, library, module
  - object with direct uses and used_bies

type file based MetaData, TextDocument

Weave in Configuration
dataclass Config with sections to yaml in ~/.odbinfo.yaml

database (driver) information retrieval


Demonstration database Herbarium
-------------------------------
Species, Genus, Family, Order, Class, Phylum, Kingdom, Domain,
Attributes, Observations, Locations
Macros that open browser on interesting Plant sites


Testing
-------
make e2e test (BaseDocumenter2dot example)
test_basic_parser_slow.py: parametrize and regression

look at Identifier construction at dependency.py:69

color highlight strings in render-token templates


Configuration
-------------
start with config.xcs, config.xcu and programmatically write and read them

Want sensible defaults for all settings.

Location of generated site
Include/Exclude parts
Database identifier in textdocuments
Link to odb file and related text-documents for download,

See BaseDocumenter config too


GUI
---
Settings dialog
Progress dialog
print --> logger.info
logging window (sfriederichs.github.io/how-to/python/gui/logging/2017/12/21/Python-GUI-Logging.html)


installation check
------------------
UI and suggestions

better description of the extension

update minimal theme (20210703 ok)

Later
-----
Use LibYAML with pyyaml
caching of query parsing
direct sql queries must be transformed to Query object
Threads: writer, parser?
i18n gettext in python, hugo {{ T id }}
make typing more complete (lot of work)
errors in parser need improvement
Clean up files after make_site if no config.keepfiles is specified
field are done last as they are nice to have
datafield-referer class as super for Control, QueryColumn, DatabaseDisplay (Report field)
python in python (nice to have)
others in python (nice to have)
look into GoHugo submenus

Limitations
-----------
SubForms within the same level in a form should have distinct names
Dialogs, Toolbars, Toolbarcontrols are omitted
Macro recursive calls are not considered
Controls more specific, eg Button...
IsCurrency Column omitted
Catalog excluded
KeyColumns, IndexColumns not used fully
