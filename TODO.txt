Testing
-------
Makefile: Unit test coverage goal
Should Unittests unpickle fixtures?
More serious unit testing, use factory_boy
Unittests for reader can use small xml-fragments
make e2e test (BaseDocumenter2dot example)
test_basic_parser_slow.py: parametrize and regression


Relevant function filter
- function that uses something else than a basicfunction
- function that is used by something else than a basicfunction

Uses should become a multiset, multiselect sources on mouseover link
https://pypi.org/project/multiset/
UsedBy should become multiset, multiselect when linking back
e.g. /#301,450,900 or /?select=300,304,600

templates:
- Form: controls linked to sun API docs.
- sql color highlighting
  - columnnames 

make upgrade dependencies (20210813 done)

type file based MetaData, TextDocument
- functionality to include the file with downloadable link (to be configurated)

database (driver) information retrieval

Makefile: cleanup minimal before distribution

More of pathlib instead of os.path

Demonstration database Herbarium
- Species, Genus, Family, Order, Class, Phylum, Kingdom, Domain,
  Attributes, Observations, Locations
  Edibility (pfaf.org)
  Macros that open browser on interesting Plant sites


Configuration
-------------
start with config.xcs, config.xcu and programmatically write and read them
Link to odb file and related text-documents for download,
See BaseDocumenter config too


GUI
- Settings dialog
- Progress dialog
- print --> logger.info
  logging window (sfriederichs.github.io/how-to/python/gui/logging/2017/12/21/Python-GUI-Logging.html)


installation check
- UI and suggestions

better description of the extension

update minimal theme (20210703 ok)

Extra graphs:
  - for table, queries, Views
  - for basicfunction, library, module
  - object with direct uses and used_bies, and all_objects (respecting excludes)
look at Identifier construction at dependency.py:85
bypass wget --convert-links with a rewrite in python of public/
- level 0 strip leading /
- level 1 strip leading /, add ../
- level 2 strip leading /, add ../../

Use LibYAML with pyyaml (on linux?)
caching of query parsing
- https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/shelve.html

direct sql queries must be transformed to Query object
Threads: writer, parser?
https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html
i18n gettext in python, hugo {{ T id }}
make typing more complete (lot of work)
errors in parser need improvement
Clean up files after make_site if no config.keepfiles is specified
field are done last as they are nice to have
datafield-referer class as super for Control, QueryColumn, DatabaseDisplay (Report field)
python in python (nice to have)
others in python (nice to have)
look into GoHugo submenus

Limitations
-----------
Dialogs, Toolbars, Toolbarcontrols are omitted
Macro recursive calls are not considered
Controls more specific, eg Button...
IsCurrency Column omitted
Catalog excluded
KeyColumns, IndexColumns not used fully
