Weave in Configuration

Flex tutorial

Graph making
------------
UseCase gets a refering location field (Union[Token, LinkedString, None])
This location should get an #id in the templates for refering back (used by)

class Dependend for DataObject s that possible use another object?
datafield-referer class as super for Control, QueryColumn, DatabaseDisplay (Report field)

Species, Genus, Family, Order, Class, Phylum, Kingdom, Domain,
Attributes, Observations, Locations
Macros that open browser on interesting Plant sites


Grid rendering like Subform

BasicCall module_token Optional? Why no mypy warning?

parent relationships
--------------------
parent inherits dependencies from children (e.g. form inhertis from SubForm and Controls)



make e2e test (BaseDocumenter2dot example)

scroll down little bit after bookmark link in modules (see basedocumenter2dot)

look at Identifier construction at dependency.py:69

color highlight strings in render-token templates

test_basic_parser_slow.py: parametrize and regression

Configuration

start with config.xcs, config.xcu and programmatically write and read them

Want sensible defaults for all settings.
