dcLid query analizeren, waarom geen tabletokens? testcase maken
parser trips over TRIM(FROM), add to grammar? yep
EXTRACT, POSITION, SUBSTRING

layout: tables index shorter

give thought to parent relationships

make e2e test (BaseDocumenter2dot example)

scroll down little bit after bookmark link in modules (see basedocumenter2dot)

look at Identifier construction at dependency.py:49

color highlight strings in render-token templates

test_basic_parser_slow.py: parametrize and regression

Configuration
-------------
start with config.xcs, config.xcu and programmatically write and read them

Want sensible defaults for all settings.

Database identifier in textdocuments

See BaseDocumenter config too

GUI
---
Settings dialog
Progress dialog

installation check
------------------
UI and suggestions


dependencies representation
---------------------------
datatype must extend generic super dataclass
with
  title
  shortname
  uses
  used_by
  parent


dependency search matrix
------------------------
tables, views in views (done)
tables, queries, views in queries (done)
tables, queries in forms

tables, queries, views in reports
fields, tables, queries, views in reports
fields, tables, views, queries in textdocuments

errors in parser need improvement

better description of the extension
