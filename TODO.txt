give thought to parent relationships

make e2e test (BaseDocumenter2dot example)

scroll down little bit after bookmark link in modules (see basedocumenter2dot)

look at Identifier construction at dependency.py:37

color highlight strings in render-token templates

refactor core.py

test_basic_parser_slow.py: parametrize and regression

Configuration
-------------
start with config.xcs, config.xcu and programmatically write and read them

Want sensible defaults for all settings.

Location of generated site
Include/Exclude parts
Database identifier in textdocuments

See BaseDocumenter config too

GUI
---
Settings dialog
Progress dialog


general
-------
direct sql queries must be transformed to Query object

installation check
------------------
UI and suggestions


dependencies representation
---------------------------
datatype must extend generic super dataclass
with
  title
  shortname
  uses
  used_by
  parent

or make a list of triplets
(Object1, Obj2, 'queries')
object1 = ("EmployeeBenefits", "query")
Obj2 = ("Employee", "table")

dependency search matrix
------------------------
tables, queries in queries
tables, queries in forms
fields, tables, queries, macros(2x) in formcontrols
tables, queries in reports
fields, tables, queries in reports
fields, tables, queries in textdocuments
tables, queries, reports in macros(2x)
basic in basic (done)
python in python (nice to have)

errors in parser need improvement

better description of the extension


Limitations
-----------
Macro recursive calls are not considered
Controls more specific, eg Button...
IsCurrency Column omitted
Catalog excluded
KeyColumns, IndexColumns not used fully
