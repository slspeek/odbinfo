templates: Listbox rendering

SubForm command type is command

Makefile: pyreverse goal: classdiagram

children, all_objects from List to Iterator

upgrade dependencies (20210813 done)

Like NamedNode.users_match have a method on Node.link_use

Fix 'recursive calls' in basicfunctions

Relevant control filter:
  ListBox handling
    --> commanddriven
  eventlisteners parsing

Graphs:
  - for table, queries, Views
  - for basicfunction, library, module
  - object with direct uses and used_bies

type file based MetaData, TextDocument

print --> logger.info
logging window (sfriederichs.github.io/how-to/python/gui/logging/2017/12/21/Python-GUI-Logging.html)

Weave in Configuration
dataclass Config with sections to yaml in ~/.odbinfo.yaml

templates: Grid rendering like Subform

class Dependend for DataObject s that possible use another object?

database (driver) information retrieval


look into GoHugo submenus

Demonstration database Herbarium
-------------------------------
Species, Genus, Family, Order, Class, Phylum, Kingdom, Domain,
Attributes, Observations, Locations
Macros that open browser on interesting Plant sites


make e2e test (BaseDocumenter2dot example)


look at Identifier construction at dependency.py:69

color highlight strings in render-token templates

test_basic_parser_slow.py: parametrize and regression

Configuration
-------------
start with config.xcs, config.xcu and programmatically write and read them

Want sensible defaults for all settings.

Location of generated site
Include/Exclude parts
Database identifier in textdocuments
Link to odb file and related text-documents for download,

See BaseDocumenter config too

GUI
---
Settings dialog
Progress dialog


general

installation check

UI and suggestions

ListBox command type is command

dependency search matrix

Macro calls in controls (eventlisteners)
tables, views, queries in ListBox
textdocuments in basic (done)
tables in tables (via its keys) (done)
tables, views in views (done)
tables, queries, views in queries (done)
tables, queries, views in reports (done)
tables, queries,views, reports in basic (done)
basic in basic (done)
tables, queries, views in forms (subforms) (done)
tables, views, queries in textdocuments (done)


better description of the extension

update minimal theme (20210703 ok)

Later
-----
direct sql queries must be transformed to Query object
Threads: writer, parser?
i18n gettext in python, hugo {{ T id }}
make typing more complete (lot of work)
errors in parser need improvement
Clean up files after make_site if no config.keepfiles is specified
field are done last as they are nice to have
datafield-referer class as super for Control, QueryColumn, DatabaseDisplay (Report field)
python in python (nice to have)
others in python (nice to have)

Limitations
-----------
SubForms within the same level in a form should have distinct names
Dialogs, Toolbars, Toolbarcontrols are omitted
Macro recursive calls are not considered
Controls more specific, eg Button...
IsCurrency Column omitted
Catalog excluded
KeyColumns, IndexColumns not used fully
